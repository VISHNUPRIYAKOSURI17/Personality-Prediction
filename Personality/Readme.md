# 🧠 Predicting Personality from Twitter

## 🔍 Introduction

**Predicting Personality from Twitter** is a data-driven project that explores how publicly shared social media data can be used to infer a user's personality traits. By analyzing the language and metadata in Twitter profiles and tweets, this system aims to predict where individuals fall on established psychological dimensions such as the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism).

This project bridges the gap between psychology and social media analysis. With accurate personality predictions, applications such as friend suggestions, targeted marketing, personalized content, and adaptive interfaces can be significantly improved.
